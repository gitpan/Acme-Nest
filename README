Acme-Nest version 0.02
======================

Are your namespaces boringly simple? Are they lacking enough of the
nesting that mark them out as real modules? Acme::Nest will add
all of that extra nesting with no extra work.

Simple use Acme::Nest with your module name as a parameter and it'll
alias My::Shiny::Module to My::Shiny::Module::Module and
My::Shiny::Module::Module::Module ad infinitum, giving you nice long
module names you can give to family and friends.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
